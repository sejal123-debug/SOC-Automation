# SOC Automation Lab Environment Setup

A complete on-premises SOC (Security Operations Center) lab built for DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response), threat detection, and log analysis. This environment includes Active Directory, Windows 10, and Kali Linux machines, with centralized log collection and simulated attacks for detection engineering and investigation.

##  Project Objective

To build a self-contained lab for SOC automation and incident response training. The goal is to:
- Understand and visualize log flows.
- Simulate real-world attacks.
- Analyze security events.
- Automate detection and response playbooks.
